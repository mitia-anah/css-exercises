        Box model CSS is a combination of four different parts of boxes in form rectangular that look like as if they had been arranged. The top one is called “Margins” which is the largest box around box and always transparent and the padding as well. The next following is the border, then the padding box and the content box is inside of all. They are used to make layout with CSS.  All the element we use in HTML are wrapped inside of them.

              Content-box is the area where we see the image or text. According to the MDN web doc that <cite><q>content-box gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.</q></cite>
