        Box model CSS is a combination of four different parts of boxes in form rectangular that look like as if they had been arranged. The top one is called “Margins” which is the largest box around the box and always transparent and it can wrap the padding as well. The next following is the border, then the padding box and the content box is inside of all. They are used to make layout with CSS. All the element we use in HTML are wrapped inside of them.

             Content-box:
            </li>
              Content-box is the area where we see the image or text. According to the MDN web doc that <cite><q>content-box gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior (width/height).</q></cite>
            <li>Padding-box:</li>
              Padding box is the area which has the form transparent around the content. That’s why we use padding when we want to size box.
            <li>Border-box:</li>
              The border box has its own special function to wrap everything inside of the content and even the padding can be wrapped as well. This needs to be applied by all border properties.
