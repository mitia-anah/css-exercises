      <ul>
        <li>Table-layout</li>
        <p>The table-layout has only two defaults values, which are `Fixed` and `Auto`.</p>
        <li>Border-spacing</li>
        <P>The default value that we can get from border-spacing is that the `length value`, which also specifies size of a vertical or horizontal spacing between cells. </P>
        <li>Border-collapse</li>
        <p>In the Border-collapse, we have those two different values, which are `separate value` and `collapse value`.  We use the ``separate value` to make a space between two border which is inside of the table we currently work on. In that case, each cells might have their own border. But for the `collapse value`, we have different value. The table is just normal. In othe word, there is no separation of any border anymore seen inside of the table. </p>
        <li>Caption-side</li>
        <p> Caption-side has varities default values that set a position in our table. They are top and bottom.</p>
        <li>Empty-cell</li>
        <p> Empty-cell is quite interesting because we can make our value to be appear or hidden by using these two possible values, which called `Show` and `Hide` </p>
