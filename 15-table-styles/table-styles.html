    </header>
    <main>
      <ul>
        <li>Table-layout</li>
        <p>The table-layout has only two defaults values, which are `Fixed` and `Auto`.</p>
        <li>Border-spacing</li>
        <P>The default value that we can get from border-spacing is that the `length value`, which also specifies size of a vertical or horizontal spacing between cells. </P>
        <li>Border-collapse</li>
        <p>In the Border-collapse, we have those two different values, which are `separate value` and `collapse value`.  We use the ``separate value` to make a space between two border which is inside of the table we currently work on. In that case, each cells might have their own border. But for the `collapse value`, we have different value. The table is just normal. In othe word, there is no separation of any border anymore seen inside of the table. </p>
        <li>Caption-side</li>
        <p> Caption-side has varities default values that set a position in our table. They are top, bottom, block-start, block-end, inline-start and inline-end.</p>
        <li>Empty-cell</li>
        <p> Empty-cell is quite interesting because we can make our value to be appear or hidden by using these two possible values, which called `Show` and `Hide` </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Simulating HTML tables</h2>
      <p> These values that we see listed bellow are correspond to ID's of the `th` elements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Table</li>
        <li>Table, table-row-group</li>
        <li>table-footer-group</li>
        <li>table-header-group</li>

Staring at a stop sign
Watching people drive by
T mac on the radio
Got so much on your mind
Nothing's really going right
Looking for a ray of hope

Whatever it is you may be going through
I know he's not gonna let it get the best of you

You're an overcomer
Stay in the fight 'til the final round
You're not going under
'Cause God is holding you right now
You might be down for a moment
Feeling like it's hopeless
That's when he reminds you
That you're an overcomer
You're an overcomer

Everybody's been down
Hit the bottom, hit the ground
Ooh, You're not alone
Just take a breath, don't forget
Hang on to his promises
He wants you to know
You're an overcomer

Stay in the fight 'til the final round
You're not going under
'Cause God is holding you right now
You might be down forâ€¦
