      <h1>Research about transition</h1>
    </header>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>The other properties that included in this shorthand are timing function, duration and delay. </li>
        <li>The transition duration is the simple way to define the total duration of a transition. But The transition-timing-function defines the speed up and slow down of the transition rate. It also describes how the animation works. In that case we use the cubic b√©zier function. Transition delay is a pause before the animation starts.</li>
        <li>The animatable CSS properties using transition are:
          <ul>
            <li>border properties</li>
            <li>background properties</li>
            <li>boxes</li>
            <li>flexes</li>
            <li>grids</li>
            <li>columns</li>
            <li>fonts</li>
            <li>clip</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We can select more than one properties to transition at a time by adding comma-separated(-transition-property), all keyword and comma separated (transition). </li>
        <li>To set or define the desired transition state, we use pseudo classes like (:hover, :active, :focus, :target, :checked(this is very useful for managing state), classes and selector.</li>
        <li>It is useful in some cases.</li>
        <li>If we make people to wait then transitions become a problem.</li>
        <li>Transitions don't work reliably with the auto keyword being one of the end states, because auto is not a number but the browser needs to do some calculations before the transitions work.</li>
        <li>To stagger transitions, wwhich means making a number of child elements all start at different times, we use the delay property.</li>
      </ol>
