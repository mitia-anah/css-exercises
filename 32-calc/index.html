          <li>A Calc() function can support number, angle, frequency, integer, fraction, text, .</li>
          <li>When we use the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, we must follow the rule like this(Brackets Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). For example:
            <b>Here is (2 + 3 * 4 )= 20</b>, but if we follow the mathematical order, we use Brackets to dwrap the 3 multiply by 4, then followed by the addition.
          </li>
          <li>We can use the cal() function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit. </li>
          <li>If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what we need to do is to cancel out the unit value.</li>
          <li>We have to put space around the (-) and (+) operator, so that it is easy to recognize as subtraction.
          </li>
          <li>Thi is a simple way to convert a value into a negative value. We just multiply the positive number with a negative number. For instance, we have something like (a + b = ab) and we want the value into a negative, so this should look (a + b = (ab)*-1) equal to (-ab).
          </li>
          <li>The calc() function can't work with colour value.</li>
