          <li>A Calc() function can support numerique value, division, multiplication, addition and subtruction.</li>
          <li>When we use the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, we must follow the rule like this(Brackets Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). For example:
            <b>Here is (2 + 3 * 4 )= 20</b>, but if we follow the mathematical order, it should look like this <b>(2 + 3 * 4)=14</b> <i>here, the multiplication is finished before the addition.</i>
          </li>
          <li>We can use the cal() function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit. </li>
          <li>If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what we need to do is to cancel out the unit value.</li>
          <li>In the Mozilla Develloper explains that (+) and (-) operators must be surrounded by whitespace. It's said that calc(50% -8px) will be defined as a percentage followed by a negative length — an invalid expression — while calc(50% - 8px) is a percentage followed by a subtraction operator and a length. Likewise, calc(8px + -50%) is treated as a length followed by an addition operator and a negative percentage.
          </li>
          <li>Thi is a simple way to convert a value into a negative value. We just multiply the positive number with a negative number. For instance, we have something like (a + b = ab) and we want the value into a negative, so this should look (a + b = (ab)*-1) equal to (-ab).
          </li>
          <li>The calc() function can work with colour value.</li>
