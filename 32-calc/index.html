        <li>A Calc() function can support numerique value, division, multiplication, addition and subtruction.</li>
        <li>Because when we use the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, we must follow the rule like this(Brackets Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). Here is the multiplication need to go first then the addition, that's why the value became 14 instead of 20.</li>
        <li>We can use the cal() function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit. </li>
        <li>If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what we need to do is to cancel out the unit value.</li>
        <li>InThe Mozilla Develloper explains that (+) and (-) operators must be surrounded by whitespace. It's said that calc(50% -8px) will be ddefined as a percentage followed by a negative length — an invalid expression — while calc(50% - 8px) is a percentage followed by a subtraction operator and a length. Likewise, calc(8px + -50%) is treated as a length followed by an addition operator and a negative percentage.
